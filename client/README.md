# Exchanger

Now Crypto Exchanger is my home project. I do this because, I need to improve my development skills. I hope, in the future, it will be a big commercial project, that will help someone get a lot of money

## npm

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Server

##### After that you should start the server

I use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to automatically restart the server.

```bash
cd server
npm run server
```

## Client

##### Next you need to start the client.

I use [react](https://ru.reactjs.org/) on the client part

```bash
cd client
npm run client
```

##### Good luck! ;)
